# Sphere Monorepo

Sphere is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that provides a suite of applications for managing digital assets and participating in decentralized financial services. This monorepo contains the code for two of Sphere's core applications: a decentralized exchange (DEX) and an NFT marketplace.

## Decentralized Exchange (DEX)

Sphere's DEX is a non-custodial exchange that allows users to trade cryptocurrencies and other digital assets without having to entrust their funds to a centralized party. The DEX uses smart contracts to automate the matching and settlement of trades, making it possible to trade in a trustless and secure manner.

## NFT Marketplace

Sphere's NFT marketplace is a platform for buying, selling, and trading non-fungible tokens (NFTs). NFTs are unique digital assets that represent ownership of a specific item or piece of content, such as an in-game item or a collectible. The marketplace uses smart contracts to handle transactions and enforce ownership rules, allowing users to trade NFTs in a secure and transparent manner.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Sphere monorepo, you'll need to have a local development environment set up. You'll need Node.js, npm, and a code editor like Visual Studio Code installed on your computer.

1. Clone the repository:

> git clone https://github.com/TeamSphere/sphere/

2. Install the dependencies:

> cd sphere

> npm install

3. Start the development server:

> npm run start

This will start a local development server that you can use to test and debug the application.
