# Keys.go

This code defines a package named crypto in the Go programming language. The package contains several imports, including the Go standard library package crypto/ed25519, crypto/rand, encoding/hex, and io, which are used for generating and managing cryptographic keys and signatures, encoding/decoding hexadecimal strings, and input/output operations respectively.

The code defines several constants that specify the length of private keys, public keys, seed values, and addresses.

The PrivateKey type is defined with a single field key of type ed25519.PrivateKey. There are several functions associated with the PrivateKey type, including:

NewPrivateKeyFromString: which creates a new private key from a hexadecimal string.

NewPrivateKeyFromSeed: which creates a new private key from a seed value.

Address: which returns the address associated with the public key.

GeneratePrivateKey: which generates a new private key.
Bytes: which returns the byte representation of the private key.

Sign: which creates a digital signature of a given message using the private key.

Public: which returns the public key associated with the private key.

The PublicKey type is defined with a single field key of type ed25519.PublicKey. There is a single function associated with the PublicKey type, Bytes, which returns the byte representation of the public key.

The Signature type is defined with a single field value of type []byte and has two associated functions: Bytes which returns the byte representation of the signature, and Verify which verifies the signature using the specified public key and message.

The Address type is defined with a single field value of type []byte and has two associated functions: Bytes which returns the byte representation of the address, and String which returns the hexadecimal string representation of the address.
