# Random.go

This util package provides a set of utility functions for generating random hashes and blocks.

## RandomHash function

This function returns a randomly generated hash as a byte slice of length 32. The hash is generated using the crypto/rand package, specifically by using the io.ReadFull function to read random bytes into the hash slice.

## RandomBlock function

This function returns a randomly generated proto.Block. The block has a header with the following attributes:

Version: a randomly generated integer from 1 to 1000.

Height: a randomly generated integer from 1 to 1000.

PrevHash: a random hash generated by the RandomHash function.

RootHash: a random hash generated by the RandomHash function.

Timestamp: the current Unix timestamp in nanoseconds, obtained from the time.Now().UnixNano function.
